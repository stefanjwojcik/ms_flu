The first wave of the survey asks for left-right ideological placement and political party affiliation, but not vote intention, separating in time the question of vote intention and ideology. Findings: they find that ideology dominates partisanship in french voting behavior. They reason that French voters do not feel the same proximate attachment to parties as americans do.},

A: Prior papers have done this analytically, by calculating the joint distribution of the popular vote margin in each state, then compute the probability of each state being both decisive and locally tied. However, the authors propose a purely empirical form in which they make an estimate of the form y/n, where n is the number of elections in a historical sample that are tied. Because they rare, they suggest y/2000n, where y is the number of elections decided by less than 1000 votes. They embed this idea into regression analysis. E: They run 10000 simulations of the the differences in the vote in each state, using the polling data as the mean in the simulations. They then calculate the probability that the margin of electoral votes is less than the number of electoral votes for that state. They then estimate the probability of votes being decisive by working with the subset of simulations in which the electoral votes in that state are necessary. P: Improves on analytical models.},

The second is based on economic conditions (specifically unemployment in the prior period and GDP in the prior period). The third is based on polling data. The author evaluates the models on the basis of 1) the errors they produce in making a forecast, in which case the polling model performs the best, and 2) in terms of the advance time in which the model can make a prediction. He finds that the polling model can only make an accurate prediction effectively on the day of the election, so concludes that the polling model is less useful. The economic model, on the other hand, can predict the result a fair period of time in advance. The author even attempts to forecast the distribution of seats, despite the obvious difficulty of the first-past-the-post system. He doesn't find much success in doing this.},

They control for ideology, class, religion, partisanship, and other variables. notes: -the context: the ability to accurately predict outcomes of elections signals the effectiveness of democracy in changing according to public will, and says something about generalizeability across contexts. -they find the strongest correlation between growth of GDP and real perceptions of the economy, so in the absence of real perceptions this may be a crucial variable. -they also find a strong correlation with inflation and economic perceptions. operationalization: -a viable coding strategy for cross-national elections is support for the government versus not - a simple binary measure.

@book{weisberg_2005,
	Annote = {Tips for surveys:
	
	1. Give the respondent a cue that you're going to ask a particular
	type of question, so they can begin thinking about it. 2. Giving
	the same choices of responses, or giving them in the same order can
	induce satisficing - known as the response set problem. 
	
	
	Tips for Survey Mode: 
	
	RDD: Random Digit Dialing (RDD) and Area Cluster Sampling are probability
	sampling modes that produce samples with different properties. RDD
	is the process of dialing random phone numbers, while cluster sampling
	generates a number of clusters across geographic regions then samples
	within them. 
	
	RDD offers a number of properties that are desirable. First, it approximates
	simple random sampling - people with phones have a [nearly] equal,
	nonzero probability of being selected. To the extent that the population
	of people with telephones represents the target population, then,
	telephone surveys are optimal. Not all people have phones, however,
	and RDD is biased against certain groups. Problems with telephone
	surveys often include undercoverage of the poor, the nonwhite, the
	young, and the rural. Households with varying numbers of people could
	also affect the randomness of the sample. 
	
	People who exclusively use cellular phones tend to be mobile, young,
	less educated, more liberal, and less politically involved. Strict
	laws govern the use of cell phones in surveys, and the mobility of
	cell phones makes geographic inclusion inconsistent. In practical
	terms, RDD is sometimes cheaper in comparison to area cluster sampling,
	since transportation and organizational costs are less.
	
	Costs associated with phones are dead lines and ineligibles. 
	
	Area Cluster Sampling: Area clustering often uses a number of stages
	to arrive at a particular case. In the first stage, clusters are
	selected across the geographic region where the target population
	resides. Cluster sampling tends to rely less on lists than telephone
	modes, thus making it a bit more accurate. Clusters are often stratified
	before final selection by some random process. For example, the number
	of clusters in urban and rural areas desired for the sample may be
	determined prior to final selection. Once clusters are selected,
	cases are selected from within the cluster for inclusion in actual
	sample. In theory, the elements in the cluster are meant to represent
	elements excluded from the sample (p.242). However, this is not usually
	achieved in practice. Area cluster sampling seeks heterogenous samples
	within clusters, but this is practically difficult, because clusters
	tend to be homogenous with respect to the elements within the cluster.
	For example, neighborhoods tend to stratify by income, race, and
	occupation types - thus making them more similar to each other internally.
	The result is that cluster sampling is inefficient with respect
	to other sampling modes when the differences in means across clusters
	varies, clusters have little within variance, and the number of clusters
	is small (p.243). 
	
	Clustering often increases the sampling error over simple random sampling
	by 1.25 to 1.5 times. In practical terms, clustering uses a large
	geographical region that makes organization and personnel needs complicated,
	expensive, and time-consuming (p.41).
